# Ray Tracing in a Weekend

Rewriting it in rust. Please check out blog post.

Learning `c++` and the basics of `c` made for a much smoother experience during this whole thing, but I also want to make sure my rust is up to speed. Advent of code is fun, but I like this more.

## Extra

Use the following code to get the render (within the directory).

```bash
cargo run --quiet > image.ppm
python converter.py # this isn't working right now?
```

Also, copilot can generate tests if you want, but make sure to do `cargo test` as well! Linting game is strong.
