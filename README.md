# Ray Tracing in a Weekend

Uploading my old code from this course to motivate me to finish it.

Learning `c++` and the basics of `c` made for a much smoother experience during this whole thing.

## Notes to Self

Use the following code to get the render.

```bash
g++ -o main main.cc
./main > image.ppm
python converter.py
```
